## Concept Development - Portfolio Piece

This assignment entailed the creation of two game prototypes - one paper and one in Unity. Guess which one this is. 

The theme was 'Side-Effects'. Since I had been playing a lot of *Celeste* at the time, I decided to make a simple 2D platformer and implement one mechanic with which to make it stand out - instead of an air dash, I went with gravity reversal. 

### Installation
At present, this portfolio piece is a little difficult to show off - this is because I found it a year after I handed it in, contained within a Google Drive folder. 

Once I have finished my [third year dissertation project](https://github.com/AlmightyGizzard/TheOraculum)  (also WIP but much more developed), I plan to open this project up, update it to a more stable Unity version, and create a .exe build for those that are generous enough to be interested in hiring me for work.
